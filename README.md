# bread_typer
A typing test for the python terminal. Now featuring bread!

When you run the program, a bread-themed quote will appear in your terminal. Just start typing the quote! Letters in the quote will appear green if you have typed them correctly and red if you have typed them incorrectly. When you're done, you will recieve how fast you typed in words per minute (wpm) and how accurate you were compared to the quote in percentage.
